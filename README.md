## 🔍 Project Overview

A web-based, AI-powered game learning system for project management education. Students navigate a Mario-style map by answering multiple-choice questions. The platform provides real-time personalized feedback via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using ChatGPT and lets professors auto-generate quizzes from uploaded PDFs.
