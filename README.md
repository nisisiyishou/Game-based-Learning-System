## üîç Project Overview
A web-based, AI‚Äêpowered game learning system designed for project management education. Students navigate a Mario-style map by answering multiple-choice questions; the platform provides real-time, personalized feedback using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and ChatGPT, and allows professors to auto-generate quizzes from uploaded PDFs.

**Key Features**  
- Interactive game interface with sprite animations  
- Professor portal for course, quiz, and question management  
- AI-driven quiz creation (PDF ‚Üí questions) and immediate feedback  
- Student dashboard with progress tracking and personalized quiz bank

## üë©‚Äçüíª My Role & Contributions
As part of a 5-person team under Dr. Faham (Civil Engineering), I led and delivered the **Student UI** and related logic:

- **Front-end & Back-end Student UI**  
  Designed and implemented React components and Django views/controllers for student registration, login, course enrollment, quiz taking, and feedback browsing.  
- **UI/UX & Database Design**  
  Crafted wireframes, selected color schemes, and mapped out the MySQL schema (User, Course, Quiz, Question, Feedback).  
- **API Integration**  
  Integrated ChatGPT API and RAG pipeline to fetch AI-generated questions and feedback into the student interface.  
- **Testing & QA**  
  Wrote and executed unit & integration tests for student flows (authentication, quiz submission, AI feedback). Mentored peers on test-case design.  
- **Client Liaison**  
  Served as the primary contact with our client (Dr. Faham): captured requirements, demoed prototypes, and incorporated feedback.
